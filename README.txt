This is version 1.0 of this project. I plan to continue working on it and "give" away the hosted version to my family for Christmas. For my final FEWD project, I wanted to focus on building a template that will allow me to build out a full website.

Next steps:

1) Content -- I need to write up the "Family Stories" and "About" sections. I also plan to continue adding more recipes.

2) Responsive Design - I built the recipe pages with both mobile and desktop breakpoints, but I need to add a tablet breakpoint and develop a responsive version of the carousel on the main page.

3) Nav Bar/Search - As I add more recipes, I will need a nav bar containing links to anchors on each page. I may also want to incorporate search functionality.

4) Additional Interactive Elements - I want to add a lightbox for the recipe cards so that you can zoom in to see them more clearly and see the back.
